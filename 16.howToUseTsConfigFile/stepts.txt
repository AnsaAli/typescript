in terminal
tsc --init
will get tsConfig File in the left side bar
target : in which version need to compiole the js code
fo modern : ES Next , but this wont work in the older browsers
Module : on which format the code need to convert : if we use UMD we can use require and import. If the project is nodejs then use common js


once we did verything, need to mention that all our code will be in the src folder, then move the index.ts file, and then create a public folder, and all the js file should be in this folder

in the tsConfigFile: we need to mention these
"rootDir" : "./src"
"outDir" : "./public"
